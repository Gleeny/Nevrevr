Never have I ever laughed so hard that I peed in my pants
Never have I ever faked fever to miss school
Never have I ever secretly eaten my baby’s baby food
Never have I ever thought of being a student of Hogwarts
Never have I ever had a crush on my teacher
Never have I ever sang a song and the background music had stopped
Never have I ever stolen money from my father’s wallet
Never have I ever wanted to be reborn as a dog
Never have I ever wished to be a superhero
Never have I ever cried in public
Never have I ever made dumb faces looking in the mirror
Never have I ever cried watching a movie
Never have I tried to repeat an action scene in the house
Never have I wanted to read my spouse’s mind while he/she said I Love You
Never have I ever travelled alone
Never have I ever counted the number of electric poles from a moving train
Never have I wished something from a metriote.
