Never have I ever been to Disney World.
Never have I ever played Mario
Never have I ever shot a gun
Never have I ever crashed a car
Never have I ever travelled with a stranger
Never have I ever forged the signature of my parents on report card
Never have I ever failed a class.
Never have I ever stayed up for more than 24 hours
Never have I ever lost the keys of my house
Never have I ever ridden an animal
Never have I ever convinced someone to get the tattoo similar to mine
Never have I tried to cut my own hair
Never have I stood dumb during a play
Never have I ever taken a lift from a stranger
Never have I jumped out of a moving train
Never have I ever had the experience of being close to death
Never have I re-gifted something that was gifted to me
